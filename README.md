Of course. A great README is essential for any professional project. It serves as a front door for new developers, a project report for stakeholders, and a reference for your future self.

Here is a comprehensive, well-structured README file. You can copy and paste this directly into a README.md file in the root of your clusterfi project.

ClusterFi - Decentralized Micro-Investment Platform

ClusterFi is a full-stack Web3 application designed to democratize gold investment through a unique model of pooled funds, underwriter capital, and NFT-based ownership. This platform allows users to make small investments, which are grouped into larger "clusters," funded by micro-lenders, and tied to real-world assets or campaigns.

Project Status: Functional MVP - On-Chain Ready

1. Project Vision

The objective of ClusterFi is to build a platform that breaks down the barriers to entry for alternative investments like gold. By allowing users to invest as little as $25, their funds are pooled into a significant $250 "cluster." This cluster is de-risked for investors by being pre-funded by an underwriter (a micro-lender), who receives a fixed interest return. The pooled capital is then deployed, profits are calculated automatically, and ownership shares are represented as tradable NFTs on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and liquidity.

This project successfully implements the three core parts of this vision:

Part 1: Core Investment Engine: The backend logic for all financial transactions, user roles, and cluster lifecycle management.

Part 2: Asset Ownership Layer: The representation of investment shares as on-chain digital assets (NFTs).

Part 3: Capital Distribution Layer: The administrative tools to link investment capital to real-world impact projects.

2. Core Concepts

Cluster: A $250 investment vehicle composed of 10 investor "shares" of $25 each.

Investor: A user who contributes $25 to a cluster to earn a share of its profits.

Underwriter: A micro-lender who provides the initial $250 capital to activate a cluster, earning a fixed interest in return.

Cluster Lifecycle: Clusters move through a distinct, automated lifecycle:

Pending ➔ Open (Funded by Underwriter) ➔ Active (Filled by Investors) ➔ Settling (Profits Calculated) ➔ Closed (Payouts Confirmed).

NFT Share: An ERC-721 token representing a legal claim to a portion of a cluster's final profits. Each active cluster generates 1 Underwriter NFT and 10 Investor NFTs.

3. Technical Architecture

This project is a modern full-stack dApp built on a serverless architecture, combining the best of Web2 reliability with Web3 transparency.

Frontend Framework: Next.js (App Router) - For a seamless, server-rendered React user interface.

Styling: Tailwind CSS - For rapid and consistent UI development.

Backend API: Vercel Serverless Functions - All backend logic is handled via API routes within the Next.js application.

Database & Authentication: Firebase

Firestore: As the primary off-chain database for user data, cluster states, and microloan campaign details.

Firebase Auth: For secure user registration, login, and role management via Custom Claims (underwriter role).

Blockchain Integration:

Smart Contract: Solidity on the Sepolia Testnet. The ClusterFiShare.sol contract is an ERC-721 token that manages NFT minting, settlement, and earnings claims.

Development Environment: Hardhat - For professional smart contract compilation, testing, and deployment.

Libraries: Ethers.js for backend interaction, and Wagmi/Viem/RainbowKit for frontend wallet connectivity.

4. Current Features & Implementation Status

The project has achieved a fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage.

Feature	Status	Implementation Details
User Authentication & Roles	✅ Complete	Firebase Auth with email/password. A secure admin API (/api/admin/set-role) assigns an underwriter Custom Claim.
Cluster Lifecycle Engine	✅ Complete	All states (Pending -> Open -> Active -> Settling -> Closed) are managed by secure backend APIs and Firestore transactions.
Investor Deposit Flow	✅ Complete	Users can invest in Open clusters. The system uses atomic Firestore transactions to prevent over-subscribing.
Profit Calculation & Settlement	✅ Complete	An admin-only API calculates and distributes profits to all stakeholders according to the business logic, creating an immutable settlement log.
On-Chain NFT Minting	✅ Complete	When a cluster becomes Active, the backend calls the safeMint function on the deployed smart contract, creating real NFTs on the Sepolia testnet for all 11 participants.
On-Chain NFT Settlement	✅ Complete	The settlement API calls settleShare on the smart contract, updating each NFT's final profit entitlement on-chain.
On-Chain Earnings Claim	✅ Complete	A UI button allows NFT owners to connect their MetaMask wallet and call the claimEarnings function on the smart contract, transferring real testnet USDC to their wallet.
Microloan Campaign Management	✅ Complete	A role-protected /admin page allows admins to create microloan campaigns and link them to active clusters, with data saved to Firestore.
Impact Project Transparency	✅ Complete	The user dashboard displays the linked microloan campaign details on each cluster card, providing transparency to investors.
Frontend Wallet Connection	✅ Complete	The application uses the professional RainbowKit library to provide a seamless wallet connection experience.
5. Roadmap & Remaining Features

While the core MVP is complete, the following features are planned to move the project to a production-ready V1 and beyond.

High Priority: Production Hardening

Implement User Profile with Wallet Linking: Create a profile page where users can permanently associate their wallet address with their account.

Settle Underwriter's On-Chain NFT: Complete the settlement API to also call setShareToClaimable for the underwriter's NFT.

Comprehensive Error Handling: Build a reconciliation service (e.g., a cron job) to handle potential failures during the on-chain minting process.

Medium Priority: User Experience & Engagement

Advanced Dashboards: Develop richer dashboards with historical data, ROI charts, and transaction history.

Notifications: Implement an email or in-app notification system to alert users to key events (e.g., "Your cluster is now Active," "Your earnings are claimable").

On-Chain Data Display: Enhance the UI to show the on-chain tokenId and provide direct links to Etherscan for each NFT, maximizing transparency.

Low Priority: Future Vision

Microloan Repayment Engine: Implement the scheduled service to simulate real-world loan repayments and display this dynamic data to investors.

NFT Secondary Marketplace: Build an in-app marketplace for users to trade their CLAIMABLE NFTs.

Mainnet Deployment: Plan the migration from testnet to a mainnet blockchain like Polygon PoS or Arbitrum One.

6. Getting Started (Developer Setup)

To run this project locally, you will need two separate terminal windows.

A. Setup the Next.js Frontend & API

Clone the repository: git clone [your-repo-url]

Navigate to the project root: cd clusterfi

Install dependencies: npm install

Setup Environment Variables:

Create a .env.local file in the root directory.

Create a Firebase project and get your frontend and admin SDK credentials.

Get a WalletConnect Project ID.

Populate .env.local with all required keys (see .env.example for a template).

Run the development server: npm run dev (This runs on http://localhost:3000)

B. Setup the Smart Contracts

Navigate to the smart contracts directory: cd smart-contracts

Install dependencies: npm install

Setup Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the smart-contracts directory.

Get a Sepolia RPC URL from a node provider like Alchemy.

Export your private key from MetaMask.

Populate .env with SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY.

Compile & Deploy:

Compile the contracts: npx hardhat compile

Deploy to Sepolia: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia

Crucially, copy the new contract address and update it in the root .env.local file.

7. Key API Endpoints

POST /api/clusters: Creates a new cluster.

POST /api/investments: Processes a user investment and triggers on-chain minting when a cluster is full.

POST /api/clusters/fund: Allows an underwriter to fund a Pending cluster.

POST /api/clusters/settle: Allows an admin to settle an Active cluster and its on-chain NFTs.

POST /api/clusters/close: Allows an admin to close a Settling cluster.
